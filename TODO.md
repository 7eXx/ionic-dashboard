# TODO's
There is a lot of work to do and improvement:
- [ ] Refactoring: some parts of the code base are duplicated. Find it and refactor it.
- [ ] Add an Interceptor that check every request verifying when user is not logged and push it to login
- [ ] Add an editor for items: initially it is not requested but can be helpful
